    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>(how we manage your data when you use Alles Search)</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Personal Information and Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      Most information is completely optional, and the only information we use
      about you for ads or results is your country, because you're probably not
      looking for a pizza restaurant that only delivers to the other side of the
      world. We'll either figure this out automatically from your IP address, or
      from your AllesID.
    </p>
    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      Yum! We don't use cookies for creepy advertising stuff, that's gross. We
      do use them to keep you signed in if you use an AllesID, and we'll set
      them if you change your theme so that our servers remember who you are and
      how you want Alles Search to work for you :)
    </p>
    <h2>Search Queries</h2>
    <p>
      We don't tell anyone else what you search for, or use it for targetted ads
      (ew). We don't keep your search queries in our database and the only
      activity we store is what results you click on in order to adjust our
      rankings and calculate the popularity of websites. Some request
      information may be logged temporarily by our webserver, but rest assured
      that we're not doing anything creepy with your search queries, because
      it's none of our business.
    </p>
    <h2>Data Protection</h2>
    <p>
      We support data protection laws like GDPR, which give power to users about
      how services can use their data. After all, it's your information. We
      don't do any creepy stuff (don't just take our word for it - most of
      <a href="https://git.alles.cx">our code is open-source</a> if you're a
      programmer and want to check this), but if you have any data requests,
      just contact us and we'll be happy to help!
    </p>
