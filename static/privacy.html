    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>(how we manage your data when you use Alles Search)</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      Most information is completely optional, and the only information we use
      about you for ads or results is your country, because you're probably not
      looking for a pizza restaurant that only delivers to the other side of the
      world. We'll either figure this out automatically from your IP address, or
      from your AllesID.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      Yum! We don't use cookies for creepy advertising stuff, that's gross. We
      do use them to keep you signed in if you use an AllesID, and we'll set
      them if you change your theme so that our servers remember who you are and
      how you want Alles Search to work for you :)
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Search Queries</h2>
    <p>
      We don't tell anyone else what you've been searching for, that stays
      between us. We don't use it for targetted ads either (ew). In order to
      prevent abuse and improve our results, we will store what you search for
      and what results you clicked on. This improves the service since we can
      see what sites are the most popular, and if our robots notice you're
      making like a billion searches in an hour, they might get a little
      annoyed. We're working on a page where you can see what we remember and
      then delete it or turn it off altogether, but for now, if you have any
      data requests (eg. you want an export of your history or you'd like it
      removed), just drop us an email or something!
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Data Protection</h2>
    <p>
      We support data protection laws like GDPR, which give power to users about
      how services can use their data. After all, it's your information. We
      don't do any creepy stuff (don't just take our word for it - most of
      <a href="https://git.alles.cx">our code is open-source</a> if you're a
      programmer and want to check this), but if you have any data requests,
      just contact us and we'll be happy to help!
    </p>
